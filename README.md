# NielsenChuangSolutions
Solutions to Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, 10th Anniversary Edition. 
This repo is meant to complement other partially-complete attempts at creating a solution manual for Nielsen and Chuang, such as https://github.com/goropikari/SolutionForQuantumComputationAndQuantumInformation.
Please use this solution manual to check your own understanding, not to skive off doing homework.
